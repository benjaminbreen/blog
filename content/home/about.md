# Biography

Thanks for visiting. I am an Assistant Professor of History at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://history.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/singleton.php?&singleton=true&cruz_id=bebreen). This fall, I'm on leave from teaching to complete work on my first book project, *The Age of Intoxication: Origins of the Global Drug Trade,* which you can read more about [here](publication/book/). I am also starting work on a second project on cross-cultural encounters involving magic and technology in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. <br> <br> For an up-to-date curriculum vitae, [click here](https://ucsc.academia.edu/BenjaminBreen/CurriculumVitae).
